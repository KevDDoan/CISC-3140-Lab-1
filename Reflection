Ojective: The project our group has decided on was to create a 2d online shooter game. It started with one person throwing out the idea of building a game and it slowly developed/built upon into the shooter game after disucssing over it. 
Process: Although the idea of the game was agreed upon by all the discussion of how the game works and what goals we want the game to achieve took some discussion before finally agreed upon. An example would be what game modes should the game have? Should some game modes be limited time? How can we make some money of this free to play game?Overall we kept it simple in our discussion and because this wasn't really a serious idea there wasn't much if any clash in ideas.
Reflection: Overall I found myself forcing myself to contribute to the conversation. I felt like I had nothing to say as there were certain individuals that took the lead and kept churning out ideas. Also my knowledge in game development is overshadowed by my fellow classmates which made it even more intimidating and I was a lot more quiet and passive than I should be. However with everything said and done working in a group has proven to be quite informative and helpful for me personally. It was a wake up call to my current knowledge and a learning experience as you pick the brains of your fellow classmates. Ultimately collaborative work to me as of this experience seems enjoyable and much more productive than working solo because even if I was more knowledgeable I feel like there are ideas that others came up with that would've never crossed my mind.
